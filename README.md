# Desalination and Salt Mass Disposal Model
This projects aims to calculate salt production from saltwater desalination process.

Subsea production systems in Natural Gas upstream cause many changes in water composition due to chemicals that are used in the process. Also unexpected changes in O&M startup processes makes the desalination conditions very dynamic.  

Free divalent ions that are in the output of the reactor is expected to be zero to fully remove hardwater content. Injection amount and free ion relationship are inspected in this model.
